  <h1>Standard #1: Learner Development</h1>
  <p>The teacher understands how learners grow and develop, recognizing that
    patterns of learning and development vary individually within and across the
    cognitive, linguistic, social, emotional, and physical areas, and designs and
    implements developmentally appropriate and challenging learning experiences (InTASC, 2013).</p>

   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b> In my EDUC 240 course, Intro to Physical & Health Education for Teachers,
 a couple of classmates and I researched milestones for second-grade students so that we may make a slideshow 
 showing those milestones. It has helped me and my classmates become more educated about how each student has
  a different “track” whenever it comes to learning in school.  Our research also shows the different types of 
  developmental milestones that are associated with more of the physical aspect such as how much they will grow
   in a year, how good their coordination should be, and how many baby teeth they should be losing per year.  
   We made this presentation so that we may be educated about the different types of milestones of development
    and be able to present this slideshow to the class so that we can spread our new knowledge of these milestones.
     During this project, we were able to dive deep into different types of milestones for things such as locomotor,
      manipulative, and non-manipulative.
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  From doing this project it has helped me realize that each student goes through 
a different process when it comes to the development of every aspect of their life. I have also learned that each
 student can or might hit different milestones at completely different times but that doesn’t change the fact that 
 they are all great in their own way. Doing this research project has helped me visualize how younger students can 
 develop as well as what the “average” student’s development looks like.
</p><p> <br>
<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact shows my competence in the standard due to the fact that it has helped me learn the different ways 
that students develop emotionally, socially, and physically as well as the different ways that I can help those 
students develop in their own ways. While doing the research for this project has also helped me realize the 
different ways that students learn and/or realize the different patterns of learning such as the same patterns 
mentioned in Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, which is where he proposed that intelligence is something 
that grows and develops in stages (Gans, 2020). I plan on using this information in my future classroom by being 
able to recognize these milestones and trying to help students develop habits to improve on certain things.
