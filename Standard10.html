  <h1>Standard #10: Leadership and Collaboration</h1>
  <p>The teacher seeks appropriate leadership roles and opportunities to take responsibility for
    student learning, to collaborate with learners, families, colleagues, other school professionals,
    and community members to ensure learner growth, and to advance the profession (InTASC, 2013).</p>

   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b> In EDUC 240, Introduction to Physical and Health Education for 
Elementary Teachers which was completed in the spring of 2022, I made a healthy snack and activity 
calendar to send home with the students so that they can work the activities as well as healthy snacks
 into their daily routine. It also allows for the students and families/communities to be able to do 
 activities together. The calendar is also used so that students can visualize what healthy habits 
 can look like laid out across a calendar. 
</p> <p> <br>

<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  This artifact has taught me different types of ways of including
 parents and the community in the students educational journey. This artifact has allowed me to learn 
 the importance of healthy habits along with forming healthy habits with younger children.
</p><p> <br>

<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence because it shows how in depth I am willing to go to get the
 students' parents and/or communities involved with my students outside of the classroom. While
  getting the parents involved with the students' lives goes along with Epsteinâ€™s theory of
   parental involvement which states that school helps the parent create a home environment 
   that supports the learner because  (Borko, 2004).
