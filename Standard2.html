  <h1>Standard #2: Learning Differences</h1>
<p>The teacher uses understanding of individual differences and
  diverse cultures and communities to ensure inclusive learning
  environments that enable each learner to meet high standards (InTASC, 2013).</p>
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>  This artifact shows my competence in the standard due to the fact 
that it has helped me learn the different ways that students develop emotionally, socially, and physically 
as well as the different ways that I can help those students develop in their own ways. While doing the 
research for this project has also helped me realize the different ways that students learn and/or realize 
the different patterns of learning such as the same patterns mentioned in Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, 
which is where he proposed that intelligence is something that grows and develops in stages (Gans, 2020).
 I plan on using this information in my future classroom by being able to recognize these milestones and 
 trying to help students develop habits to improve on certain things.
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  I learned a lot about different activities that students like to do a 
lot of different varieties of activities with the people they love at home as well as being able to help 
their community such as making a scavenger hunt and then invite at least 3 new people. It has also helped 
me with more of an idea of what I can do to make sure that my students' parents can be more involved in 
their life as well as be more active in their own ways with them. During this activity, I discovered 
that students that can learn with their parents outside of school can be more well-rounded overall.

<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence due to the fact that I have been able to create and/or 
modify a classroom environment to make sure that each student is comfortable as well as feels safe 
in my classroom. This artifact shows my competence in creating a supportive classroom as well creating
 a classroom that encourages a social environment which via Skinner’s theory of environmental development 
 shows that factors such as a student's environment can directly affect a student’s willingness to learn or 
 even their mood over about the classroom (Yeoman, 2022).
