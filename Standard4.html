  <h1>Standard #4: Content Knowledge</h1>
  <p>The teacher understands the central concepts, tools of inquiry, and structures of the
    discipline(s) he or she teaches and creates learning experiences that make these aspects of
    the discipline accessible and meaningful for learners to assure mastery of the content (InTASC, 2013).</p>
 <p> <br>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>   In my EDUC  233 course, Literacy Development through Childrenâ€™s Literature class 
which was completed in May of 2021, I made a children's book of my own online in Google Slides with clipart and general 
shapes. Overall the book was about a young girl finding what she loved to do and turning it into her career.
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  The biggest thing I learned from doing this project was how to relate to 
children so that they can learn from the book and have fun whilst reading it. Writing this book has helped me 
think about different ways of teaching via reading/writing more books such as being able to write more books
 that can teach lessons in a simple way for the students. Writing this book has also taught me how much you can
  teach a student just by reading a book or having them read certain books. It has also allwoed me to learn different ways of 
  being able to test readers comprehension of stories they have recently read.
</p><p> <br>
<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence because I can create new learning experiences for my students in a way 
that they can understand easily, enjoy, as well as visualize. This artifact also shows my competence in being able
 to make a learning aid that will be able to assist in the learning of some students that are included in <b>Fleming's 
  VARK</b> learning style of visual and when I go to read it out loud to students it can also help the students that fall 
 into the aural or auditory learning style (Prithishkumar, 2014).
