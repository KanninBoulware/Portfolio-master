  <h1>Standard #6: Assessment</h1>
<p>The teacher understands and uses multiple methods of assessment
  to engage learners in their own growth, to monitor learner progress,
  and to guide the teacher’s and learner’s decision making (InTASC, 2013).</p>
 
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>  In my EDUC 121 course, Child & Adolescent Development, which was
 completed in December of 2020, I conducted a child case study about a child that had auditory processing 
 disorder. I began the study by talking to the parents and child to find out what we need to be paying 
 attention to as well as work on which consisted of trying to get the child to be aware of their surroundings
  when speaking, really just working on the volume control. We continued to spend time with them multiple 
  times through the months during the study and continued work on their volume control. By the end of the study,
   they were able to be focused on something while unconsciously having a sensible volume of speaking.</p> <p> <br>

<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  What I learned from doing this child study is ways of assessing learners’ 
progress to assist them as they learn via knowing/figuring out what their strengths and weaknesses are.  
It has also taught me how to use different activities to be able to watch the minute details of different 
children's learning habits. For example, giving the child an activity that will keep them focused and 
learning so you can watch them to see what they are struggling or what they are excelling at.

<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence in the standard due to the fact that this artifact has pushed me to
 be able to come up with activities that monitor a learner’s thought process throughout the activity. It also
  shows that via the activities, I can use the progress that they have made to help them and/or future educators
   know the best ways to educate them. This artifact shows that I am able to figure out and adapt activities around 
   the learner’s style of learning centered around Fleming’s VARK model of learning, which talks about the four 
   different types of learning styles such as visual, auditory, read/write, and kinesthetic.
