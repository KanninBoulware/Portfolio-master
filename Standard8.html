  <h1>Standard #8: Instructional Strategies</h1>
<p>The teacher understands and uses a variety of instructional strategies to
  encourage learners to develop deep understanding of content areas and
  their connections, and to build skills to apply knowledge in meaningful ways (InTASC, 2013).</p>
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b> In my EDUC 224 course, Introduction to Scientific Inquiry, 
which was completed in December of 2021, my classmates and I researched in-depth topics such as active
 learning strategies, differentiated instruction, and cross-disciplinary teaching so that we could use 
 this information in different ways. After doing the research on cross-disciplinary teaching we were 
 able to respond to a parent, via email, that was worried that we weren’t focused enough on reading 
 as compared to science but since it was a cross-disciplinary lesson plan it covered multiple curricula. 
 The research that was done for differentiated instruction was also used in a way that was similar 
 to a cross-disciplinary lesson plan in the same way that we were responding to an email; we used the
  information so that we could formulate a plan to include different ways of teaching such as even 
  reading with partners. The final bit of research that was done was over active learning strategies
   which were used to make an engaging PowerPoint so that we could show/present the PowerPoint at a 
   PTO meeting to parents and colleagues alike. The PowerPoint could inform them about different ways 
   that active learning strategies can be used inside and outside the classroom.
</p> <p> <br>

<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>   Doing the research on these topics has taught me about different 
types of instructional strategies ranging from things such as implementing small groups to make students 
feel more comfortable with their peers as well as even trying to make the classroom quieter, so 
some students don’t get overstimulated by the amount of sound in the classroom. One of the biggest 
things it has taught me overall is that it is actually pretty easy to change your lesson plan/classroom
 around to accommodate students and their needs. For example I can make the lesson plan more hands-on 
 so that kinesthetic learners can excel and/or make the lesson plan centered around visual aids so that the visual learners can excel.

<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
These artifacts demonstrate my competence in the standard because it shows that I am able to research 
and build new skills on top of the one that I previously had. It has also allowed me to have a wide
 variety of different strategies for instruction such as being able to make lesson plans based around
  how different students learn. It also shows that I am able to adapt my classroom to accommodate students
   with any learning style and change the lesson plan so that it can do so, which shows that I can 
   accommodate any student that would fall into Fleming’s theory of the VARK model of learning (Boradbent, 2021).
    The VARK model of learning states that we are one of four types of learners.  For example I can make a 
    lesson plan that can accommodate the visual learners by using visual aids so that they can understand the lesson easier.
