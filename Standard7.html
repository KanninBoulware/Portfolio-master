  <h1>Standard #7: Planning for Instruction</h1>
  <p>The teacher plans instruction that supports every student in meeting rigorous learning
    goals by drawing upon knowledge of content areas, curriculum, cross-disciplinary skills,
    and pedagogy, as well as knowledge of learners and the community context (InTASC, 2013).</p>
 
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>  In my EDUC 224 course, Introduction to Scientific Inquiry, which
 was completed in December of 2021, my classmates and I made a cross-disciplinary lesson plan for a 
 fourth-grade class using science, reading/language arts, and art as the main lesson subjects. The main goal 
 of this lesson plan was to educate the fourth-grade students about the phases of the moon so that they
  can identify and label the phases. Our group first starts the lesson plan by asking the students a variety
   of questions to find out what they know about the moon such as “Does the shape of the moon change from
    one night to another?” Next, we watch a cute and age-appropriate video to explain what the phases of 
    the moon are as well go through a PowerPoint, which is located on the lesson plan, so that we can go 
    in-depth on why they are that shape. Shortly after we went through the PowerPoint we proceeded to split
     the class into pairs for the activity that we had planned for the activity. The activity that follows 
     consists of getting Oreos and using popsicle sticks to scrap the cream between the Oreos to form the 
     phases of the moon on a template that we had printed for the students. The last thing we did to finish 
     the lesson plan was let the students color in a picture of an astronaut, which was similar to the one we
      just finished reading about. 
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  I have learned how to make cross-disciplinary lesson plans involving
 science, reading/language arts, and art which I will be using later on in my educational career whilst 
 making lesson plans. One of the biggest things I have learned is how to be more enthusiastic during 
 lesson plans so that the students will feel more connected to what they are learning because if you aren’t 
 enthusiastic about teaching then they won’t want to listen. Creating this lesson plan while working with my 
 classmates has shown me how much easier it can be when the lesson plan is overall more detail-oriented.
</p><p> <br>
<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence in the standard because the lesson plan that my classmates and I 
have completed shows that I can create a well-rounded cross-disciplinary lesson plan that can help students 
visualize what they are learning. It also shows that I can create a lesson plan that can appeal to any form 
of learning, such as visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic, just as <b>  Neil Fleming</b> theorized in 
the <b>VARK</b> model of learning. The <b>VARK</b> model of learning states that we are one of four types of learners 
(Boradbent, 2021). For example, I can make a lesson plan that can accommodate the visual learners by using
 visual aids so that they can understand the lesson easier or since we are doing things hands-on the lesson
  plan is catered to the kinesthetic learner.
