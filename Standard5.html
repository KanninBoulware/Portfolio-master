  <h1>Standard #5: Application of Content</h1>
<p>The teacher understands how to connect concepts and use differing
  perspectives to engage learners in critical thinking, creativity, and
  collaborative problem solving related to authentic local and global issues (InTASC, 2013).</p>
 
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>In my EDUC 230 course, The Exceptional Child, which was completed in March of 
2021, I made a lesson plan for a fourth-grade class using math and science as the main subjects for the lesson plan. 
In said lesson plan I decided to do an egg drop project with the class after we have been learning about gravity 
throughout the previous two weeks. I have also made accommodations for students with auditory processing difficulties
 because, during this class, the main exceptional need that I was researching was auditory processing disorder. 
 I have also made sure that I will remind them almost every day about the egg drop project that is happening on 
 the Friday of that second week just in case because some kids probably won’t remember to tell their parents on the first day.
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b> I have learned how to make a well-rounded lesson plan along with the best ways to create 
accommodations for any student within projects and lesson plans. This lesson plan has helped me learn how to create lesson 
plans that will challenge students' problem-solving skills. It has also helped me realize that the best way to follow up on 
projects/experiments like this is to ask them engaging questions so that they can put what they just witnessed into words and 
store it in their minds. It has also taught me how relate different types of lesson to globl and local issue through the use of for example money,
in this lesson plan I can use money to relate how much this will cost to do compared to other countries.
</p><p> <br>
<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence in the standard due to the fact that this lesson plan shows that I can create a lesson 
plan that will challenge students' problem-solving skills and creative thinking. It uses the fact that I will be teaching them 
about gravity and inertia and then showing via the egg drop project how those forces can affect objects so that they can visualize
 it. This is discussed in <b> Fleming’s</b>  theory of visual learning represented in his <b>VARK model</b> because they can visualize what is 
 happening from multiple perspectives so that they can put it in their own words and they can remember it in their own way 
 (Broadbent, 2021). For example, they are able to see how their classmates thought differently about how to protect the egg 
 from breaking along with being able to have a more of a kinesthetic learning experience via building the project.
