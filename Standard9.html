  <h1>Standard #9: Professional Learning and Ethical Practice</h1>
<p>The teacher engages in ongoing professional learning and uses evidence
  to continually evaluate his/her practice, particularly the effects of his/her
  choices and actions on others (learners, families, other professionals, and
  the community), and adapts practice to meet the needs of each learner (InTASC, 2013).</p>
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>  In my EDUC 224 course, Introduction to Scientific Inquiry completed in
 December of 2021, I decided to sign up to volunteer at TechWise Academy so that I could get some extra credit 
 as well as extra experience. I decided to volunteer on the 10th of December in 2021 from 6 pm to 8 pm. 
 The subject of the night was teaching young students the basics of blockchain coding via Minecraft Education Edition. 
 Using Minecraft Education Edition in this day and age is overall a good choice because there are young students 
 that can learn from this visual coding really easily. I was able to see what they do on a weekly basis with some
  of their students and it was amazing to see some of the students would have a great time while learning the basics
   of coding. About a week after I had volunteered at TechWise Academy I got an email from the co-founder, Ryan Hunter,
    asking if I would like a part-time job working as a teaching assistant during the spring semester of 2022. After
     about a day of consideration I decided to take him up on the part-time position as a teaching assistant,
      it was the best decision I made in my career. I have now been working at TechWise Academy for over four 
      months now. I have helped and encouraged so many students to push themselves to their full potential whilst 
      learning to code. The best thing that I have seen working at TechWise Academy is the students that when they 
      first started to come to classes they struggled with the basics but eventually were able to write complex orders
       of code to be able to do the coding puzzles in class.
</p> <p> <br>
<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>   I have experienced/learned many different things from working, such as being 
able to identify different types of learners and even the best ways to teach coding to younger students. It has 
also given me the chance to go into an in-person classroom environment which in today's world is hard to do while
 pursuing a teaching career unless you are already a teacher. I have also learned how to create my first 
 technology-based lesson plan that will be used in a classroom environment.

<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence in the standard because it shows as a future educator that I am willing to
 go above and beyond so that I can expand my knowledge about education/teaching. It also shows that I am willing to 
 continually work on my professional development while even still getting my teaching degree which attributes to 
<b>Borkoâ€™s</b> theory of professional development, which states that a well-rounded teacher will always continue their 
 professional development, such as being able to have different types of new experiences in the field (Borko, 2004).
