<h1>Standard #3: Learning Environments</h1>
<p>The teacher works with others to create environments that support
  individual and collaborative learning, and that encourage positive
  social interaction, active engagement in learning, and self motivation (InTASC, 2013).</p> 
 <p>
   <p>
<b>Brief Description of Evidence: </b>  In my EDUC 233 course, Literacy Development through Children’s 
Literature class, which will be completed in May of 2022, my classmates and I made a classroom design and a booklist 
for my classroom library that so we will have a solid baseline for my future classroom. Attached at the 
end of this page is the list of over 30 books labeled for what grade it is written for. In the 
classroom design, we made the layout by putting students into groups so as to not leave anyone out.</p> <p> <br>

<b>Analysis of What I Learned:</b>  One of the biggest things that I have learned from doing this assignment
 is the best ways of laying out a classroom in a way to make sure that every student has the best
  experience possible in the classroom. Another thing that I have learned has to be the best kinds
   of books to have in the classroom as well as to have a very big variety of reading levels within
    the classroom because each student is on a different reading level compared to the other.</p><p> <br>
      
<b>How This Artifact Demonstrates My Competence in the InTASC Standard: </b> 
This artifact demonstrates my competence due to the fact that I have been able to create and/or 
modify a classroom environment to make sure that each student is comfortable as well as feels safe 
in my classroom. This artifact shows my competence in creating a supportive classroom as well creating
 a classroom that encourages a social environment which via <b>Skinner’s theory of environmental development</b> 
 shows that factors such as a student's environment can directly affect a student’s willingness to learn or 
 even their mood over about the classroom (Yeoman, 2022).
